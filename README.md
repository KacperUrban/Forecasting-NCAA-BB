# Forecasting-NCAA-BB

This project was built during the kaggle contest. It is focused to predict every matchup during NCAA tournament phase.

# Overview
I have created a data description. You can find it in data_desc.docx. Also I created few notebooks: feature_eng, EDA, main. In EDA I conducted basic explanatory data analysis, in feature_eng I experiment with different features. Main notebook was created for final submission. All findings you can find in notebooks. In future I will summarize all experiments, findings etc. in this README file.

# Status
The project is on going. I will develop feature engeenring, model selection and model hyperparameters tunning.
